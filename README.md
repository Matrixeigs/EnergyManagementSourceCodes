Optimization techniques and their applications in power systems
===
#Two parts of works are presented in the optimization package.
>1) Modelling
>>a) AC networks

>>b) DC networks

>>c) Hybrid AC/DC networks

>>d) Thermal systems

>>e) Transportation systems

>>f) Gas systems

>2) Algorithms
>>a) Interior point method

>>b) Branch and bound

>>c) Benders decomposition

>>d) Generalized Benders decomposition

>>e) ADMM

>>f) Column and constraint generation

>>g) Scenario generation and reduction


Three commercial software packages are required for the deployment of this package,
>1) Gurobi,
>2) Mosek
>3) Cplex.

Most recent interest is on deep reinforcement learning for optimization problems.

The mathematical models can be found via the following websites:[Goolge scholar](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=r-F063gAAAAJ&hl=en),[Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianyang_Zhao5), and [Google site](https://sites.google.com/view/tyzhao/home).
